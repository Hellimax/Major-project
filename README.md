<h2>To generate data</h2>
run command "python data_generator.py 10" last argument specifies the no: of images for each type of word length images, the word length ranges from 4 charactors to 15 charactor so if you specify last argument as 10 that means 10 images for 4 charactor length word, 10 images for 5 charactor length word and so on and you will have a total of 120 images
